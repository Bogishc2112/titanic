Kaggle Titanic Survival Prediction Challenge
Current model is represented as a classical 3 layer perceptron, with accuracy 73%.
Current goals: examine other possible algorithms that are applicable to a problem, evaluate them by their possible effectivness in terms of the challenge, and implement the one of them to improve acuracy.
